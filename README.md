# ECENGR180DB

Project with Networking and MediaPipe (will need to download needed dependencies (refer to earlier labs))

To run MediaPipe:
1. Open Gesture Folder
2. Activate Conda Environment: conda activate (environment name)
3. Run python program: python gesture+localization.py


Might Change from user to user:
1. Line 183 in gesture+localization.py   boxdimension = 150 ---> change the dimensions to whatever suits your device
2. In Scorer.cs, change the path outputPath to the path of the file gesturefile.txt on your local device.
3. Change the IP in Network Manager/NetMan/Network Manager/Network Info/Network Address to you local IP address.
